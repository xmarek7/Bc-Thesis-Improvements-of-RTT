%% The \chapter* command can be used to produce unnumbered chapters:
\chapter*{Introduction}
%% Unlike \chapter, \chapter* does not update the headings and does not
%% enter the chapter to the table of contents. I we want correct
%% headings and a table of contents entry, we must add them manually:
\markright{\textsc{Introduction}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

\chapter{Previous works}
Rather quick description of batteries, RTT, RTT PY and why we want to improve them.
\section{Randomness testing}
Motivation for randomness testing in general.
\section{Tests batteries}
Mentioning Dieharder, NIST etc directly
\section{RTT}
\section{RTT PY}

\chapter{Theoretical part - how testing works}
The theory behind the randomness testing - how the tests work, explanation of p-values and how to interpret the results.
\section{First level testing}
P-values, different probability distributions
\section{Second level testing}
KS-statistic, $\chi^2$-test etc.


\chapter{Practical part - describing current status}
Deeper description of both the RTT and RTT PY. How they work, their outputs etc... Maybe some of the individual tests batteries. 


\chapter{Practical part - what was the plan and what was done}
This part will definitely  be split into more chapters. Will depend on what and howexactly will be done. Some of the expected parts:
\section{Changes done to RTT PY}
\section{Tests for RTT PY}






\appendix %% Start the appendices.
\chapter{An appendix}
Here you can insert the appendices of your thesis.
